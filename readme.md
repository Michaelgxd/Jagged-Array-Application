### Task: Jagged Array Application ###

Dr Hunter teaches 3 sections of her Intro to Computer Science class.  She has 12 students in section 1, 8 students in section 2, and 10 students in section 3.  Find the following attached files:

>  Section 1.txt - Contains the final exam scores for each student in section 1.  12 integer scores

>   Section 2.txt - Contains the final exam scores for each student in section 2.  8 integer scores

>    Section 3.txt - Contains the final exam scores for each student in section 3.  10 integer scores

 

Create application that reads these 3 files and stores their contents in a jagged array.  The array's first row should hold the exam scores for the students in section 1,  the second row should hold the exam scores for the students in section 2, the third row should hold the exam scores for the students in section 3.  

The application should display each section's exam scores in a separate ListBox control and then use the Jagged Array to determine the following:

   - The average exam score for each individual section

   - The average exam score for all the students in the 3 sections.

   -  The highest exam score among all 3 sections and the section in which that score was found

   -   The lowest exam score among all 3 sections and the section in which that score was found
